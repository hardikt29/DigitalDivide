# DigitalDivide
Technology has grown very rapidly in last few decades. It is everywhere; from Mega to Mini , Micro to Nano.
It has already spread across the world.
Along with the expansion of  technology, the prices and disadvantages for new technologies are also increasing.
Only few people can afford the new technology but others can’t. This only creates “Digital Divide”.
Digital Divide is not only created by the prices, there are also other reasons for this disaster. Digital Divide basically refers to the gap between those able to benefit technology and those who are not.
Technology should serve everyone as equal.
It can be seen in every field related with technology.It can be seen in all hardware and software.
# Impacts Of Digital Divide

## Political
In the age of social media, political empowerment and mobilization are difficult without digital connectivity.

## Governance
Transparency and accountability are dependent on digital connectivity. The digital divide affects e-governance initiatives negatively.

## Social
Internet penetration is associated with greater social progress of a nation. Thus digital divide in a way hinders the social progress of a country.

Rural India is suffering from information poverty due to the digital divide. It only strengthens the vicious cycle of poverty, deprivation, and backwardness.

## Economic
The digital divide causes economic inequality between those who can afford the technology and those who don’t.

## Educational
The digital divide is also impacting the capacity of children to learn and develop.
Without Internet access, students can not build the required tech skills.
